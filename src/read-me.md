README for React Meme Generator Project
Project Overview
This project is a simple meme generator built using React. The application allows users to add custom text to a randomly generated meme image.

Key Concepts
Setting Up Your React App
To create a new React application, you can use the create-react-app command. This command sets up the necessary project structure and installs the required dependencies.

The npm install command is used to install the dependencies listed in the package.json file. These dependencies are stored in the node_modules directory.

A typical React project includes the following files and directories:

public: contains the index.html file and other static assets
src: contains the React components and other source files
package.json: lists the project dependencies and scripts
Structure of Your React Application
Structuring your application in a way that is easy to understand and maintain is important. In this project, the UI is broken down into reusable components, such as the Header and Meme components.

Data is passed between components using props. For example, the Meme component receives the topText and bottomText props from its parent component.

State Management in React
State is a way to manage data and behavior in a React component. In this project, state is used to store the meme image and text.

The useState hook is used to manage state in functional components. For example, the Meme component uses useState to manage the meme state object.
